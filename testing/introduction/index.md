# My Amazing Self

"So, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?" Sure... My name is Brandon and I have struggled with the answer to this question for my entire life. Did I say this was going to be "Simple"? *Chuckles to himself* This question always invokes more questions than answers for me, what does it mean to be Brandon? Am I defined by where I have already been? Just a collection of events, choices, and achievements from my past or am I defined only by who I am in this moment? What about the future? I can tell you that I am not the same person I was yesterday and likely won't be the same tomorrow. Therein, maybe, lies a small fragment of the truth of things. I am driven by this need to grow, evolve, and learn. Whether it's a new skill, emerging science and technologies, spirituality, or simply learning what it means to be my authentic self. With this blog, I am hoping to open a little window into this journey that I am on with you, the reader. Maybe, together, we can find some answers in all of this.

# The Past (The Box, The Fortress/Prison and The Mask)

My past is a bit of a mixed bag. Somewhere along the line, unbeknownst to me, my life started to take a turn towards a series of events that would eventually unravel my life as I knew it. I had a loving family that did everything they could to support and encourage me, I even had a handful of good friends at any given time, while growing up. There always seemed to be something missing, though, I can't quite put my finger on it. I have always had people in my life that had these deep connections with me, but I never quite understood how to connect back. I thought that this meant that I was broken and I was terrified by the idea of someone finding out and seeing the real me. The knowledge that I wasn't quite like most of the others in my life started to isolate me to the confines of my mind. Too my surprise, I didn't feel anymore alone in there, I found a level of comfort and safety inside this box I had placed myself in. In here, away from the judgement of others, I could be myself. 

From this point forward, I began to live two lives; One as myself, safely tucked away. One as the pretender, becoming whatever best suited my current situation, whatever would allow me to return to the fantasy of my imagination and keep the others from looking too deeply.  

From this point forward, I began to live two lives: one as myself, safely tucked away, and another as the pretender, becoming whatever best suited my current situation. This facade allowed me to return to the fantasy of my imagination and keep the "others" from looking too deeply.

 and fear began it's subtle campaign for absolute power over my life.


Gazed longingly into the world through the windows of my eyes.

Was fascinated at staring deep into the eyes of others, I think I was hoping that behind the curtain of their iris, I would see another person hiding in their own little box looking back at me.

Others in school were drawn to large parties and alcohol, I had an immediate dislike, almost hatred towards the bevarage. I saw how it stripped all inhibition away from the others and I saw it as a threat to the facade that I had built around me. What if I got too relaxed and clumsily waltz out the front gate of my mental fortress that has been keeping me safe for so long. I couldn't take the risk, not yet anyway, there is still so much work to do and I am not ready for the real world.
# The Present

# The Future

Well, I am a human. I often joke that I identify as a robot, because I find computers are frequently easier to understand and relate to.
